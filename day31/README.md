# Day 31 - Password Generator

Warning: for security reasons I recommend using more secure solutions, like dedicated libraries for password generation.

Simple password generator generating passwords based on the following criteria: password length, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and / or symbols. Generator allows to copy password to clipboard with only one click!
